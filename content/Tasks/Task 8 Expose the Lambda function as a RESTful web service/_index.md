## Task 8: Expose the Lambda Function as a RESTful Web Service

In this crucial task, we'll leverage Amazon API Gateway to expose our Lambda functions as a RESTful web service. This enables easy invocation of our application logic using standard HTTP protocols, enhancing accessibility and integration capabilities.

## Creating the API Gateway

1. Navigate to the AWS Management Console
2. In the search bar, type "API Gateway" and select it
3. In the REST API panel, click "Build"
4. Configure the API details:
   - Choose "New API"
   - API name: `PostReaderAPI`
   - Description: API for PostReader Application
   - Endpoint Type: Regional
5. Click "Create API"

## Configuring HTTP Methods

### POST Method

1. In the Resources pane, select the root (/) resource
2. Click "Create Method" and choose POST
3. Set up the Lambda Function:
   - Lambda Function: Select the function containing `PostReader_NewPost`
4. Click "Create Method"

### GET Method

1. In the Resources pane, select the root (/) resource
2. Click "Create Method" and choose GET
3. Set up the Lambda Function:
   - Lambda Function: Select the function containing `PostReader_GetPost`
4. Click "Create Method"

## Enabling CORS

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) allows invoking the API from different hostnames:

1. Select the root (/) resource
2. Click "Enable CORS"
3. Configure CORS settings:
   - Gateway responses: Select "Default 4XX" and "Default 5XX"
   - Access-Control-Allow-Methods: Select GET and POST
4. Click "Save"

## Configuring Query Parameters

For the GET method:

1. Select the GET method
2. In Method Request settings, click "Edit"
3. Expand "URL Query String Parameters"
4. Add a query string:
   - Name: `postId`
5. Click "Save"

## Setting Up Request Mapping

To ensure proper JSON formatting:

1. Select the GET method
2. Go to the "Integration Request" tab
3. Edit the settings:
   - Request body passthrough: "When there are no templates defined (recommended)"
4. Expand "Mapping Templates"
5. Add a mapping template:
   - Content-Type: `application/json`
   - Template body:
     ```json
     {
         "postId": "$input.params('postId')"
     }
     ```
6. Click "Save"

## Deploying the API

1. Click "Deploy API"
2. Create a new stage:
   - Stage name: `Dev`
3. Click "Deploy"
4. Copy the "Invoke URL" and save it for future use

## ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations!

You've successfully exposed your Lambda functions as a RESTful web service using Amazon API Gateway. This powerful integration allows for seamless communication between your serverless backend and various front-end applications or services.

### Next Steps
- Test your API endpoints using tools like Postman or cURL
- Implement proper security measures, such as API keys or AWS Cognito integration
- Consider setting up API usage plans and throttling to manage traffic

By completing this task, you've added a crucial layer of accessibility to your serverless blog-to-audio application, paving the way for robust and scalable client interactions.
