#### Creating an Admin User

1. From the left pane of the IAM console, select **Users** then click on **Add User**.
2. Enter a User name (For example, `AdminUser`).
   - To allow the user to be authenticated for web-console access, check **AWS Management Console access**. 
   - To allow the user to be authenticated for AWS API, CLI, and SDK access, check **Programmatic Access**.
   - To set your own password instead of using an autogenerated one, click **Custom password** and type in your desired password. Uncheck **User must create a new password at next sign-in** to avoid being prompted to create a new password on the first login.  (note: you must remember this password for future logins)
   - Click **Next:Permissions**.

3. Click the **Add user to group** tab and select **AdminGroup** which we had created earlier.
4. Click **Next:Tags**
   - Tags are an optional option to organize, track, or control user access, so you can either add your appropriate tags or skip this step.
5. Click **Next:Review**.
6. Review the user details then select **Create User**.

After creating the user, you will offered to download a file containing the access credentials as needed. Please store this securely until the credentials have been communicated with your users. Once they are able to access their IAM users, you may securely delete this file.
