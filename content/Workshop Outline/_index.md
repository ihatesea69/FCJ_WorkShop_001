#### Choose an AWS Support plan

- On the **Select a Support Plan** page, choose one of the available Support plans. For a description of the available Support plans and their benefits, see [Compare AWS Support Plans](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/plans/).

#### Wait for your account to be activated



After you choose a Support plan, a confirmation page indicates that your account is being activated. Accounts are usually activated within a few minutes, but the process might take up to 24 hours. \
You can sign in to your AWS account during this time. The AWS home page might display a Complete Sign Up button during this time, even if you've completed all the steps in the sign-up process. \
Once your account is fully activated, you will receive a confirmation email. Check your email and spam folder for the confirmation email. After you receive this email, you have full access to all AWS services.
