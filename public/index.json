If Create a new AWS account isn\u0026rsquo;t visible, first click on Sign in to a different account, and then click Create a new AWS account. Enter the account information and and then select Continue. Important: Make sure you enter the correct information, especially email. Select the type of account. Note: Personal and Professional both share the same features. Enter your company or personal information. Important: For professional AWS accounts, it\u0026rsquo;s a best practice to enter the company phone number rather than a personal cell phone. Read and agree to the AWS Customer Agreement. Select Create Account and Continue. Add a payment method On the Payment Information page, enter the information about your payment method, and then choose Verify and Add.\nNote: If you want to use a different billing address for your AWS billing information, select Use a new address before you select Verify and Add. Verify your phone number Choose your country or region code from the list. Enter a phone number where you can be reached in the next few minutes. Enter the code displayed in the CAPTCHA, and then submit. In a few moments, an automated system contacts you. Enter the PIN you receive, and then choose Continue. Choose an AWS Support plan On the Select a Support Plan page, choose one of the available Support plans. For a description of the available Support plans and their benefits, see Compare AWS Support Plans. Wait for your account to be activated After you choose a Support plan, a confirmation page indicates that your account is being activated. Accounts are usually activated within a few minutes, but the process might take up to 24 hours. You can sign in to your AWS account during this time. The AWS home page might display a Complete Sign Up button during this time, even if you\u0026rsquo;ve completed all the steps in the sign-up process. Once your account is fully activated, you will receive a confirmation email. Check your email and spam folder for the confirmation email. After you receive this email, you have full access to all AWS services.\n"

	"content": "what the hellllll test test test 123 Overview In general, speech synthesis is not easy. You cannot assume that when an application reads each letter of a sentence, the output makes sense. A few common challenges for text-to-speech applications include:\nWords that are written the same way, but that are pronounced differently: I live in Las Vegas compared to This presentation broadcasts live from Las Vegas. Text normalization: Disambiguating abbreviations, acronyms, and units: St., which can be expanded as Street or Saint. Converting text to phonemes in languages with complex mapping, such as, in English, tough, through, and though. In this example, similar parts of different words can be pronounced differently depending on the word and context. Foreign words (déjà vu), proper names (François Hollande) and slang (ASAP, LOL). AWS Account An AWS account is the basic container for all the AWS resources you can create as an AWS customer. By default, each AWS account will have a root user. The root user has full access within your AWS account, and root user permissions cannot be limited. When you first create your AWS account, you will be assessing it as the root user.\nAs a best practice, do not use the AWS account root user for any task where it\u0026rsquo;s not required. Instead, create a new IAM user for each person that requires administrator access. Thereafter, the users in the administrators user group should set up the user groups, users, and so on, for the AWS account. All future interaction should be through the AWS account\u0026rsquo;s users and their own keys instead of the root user. However, to perform some account and service management tasks, you must log in using the root user credentials.\nMulti-Factor Authentication (MFA) MFA adds extra security because it requires users to provide unique authentication from an AWS supported MFA mechanism in addition to their regular sign-in credentials when they access AWS websites or services.\nIAM User Group An IAM user group is a collection of IAM users. User groups let you specify permissions for multiple users, which can make it easier to manage the permissions for those users. Any user in that user group automatically has the permissions that are assigned to the user group.\nIAM User An IAM user is an entity that you create in AWS to represent the person or application that uses it to interact with AWS. A user in AWS consists of a name and credentials. Please note that an IAM user with administrator permissions is not the same thing as the AWS account root user.\nAWS Support AWS Basic Support offers all AWS customers access to our Resource Center, Service Health Dashboard, Product FAQs, Discussion Forums, and Support for Health Checks – at no additional charge. Customers who desire a deeper level of support can subscribe to AWS Support at the Developer, Business, or Enterprise level.\nCustomers who choose AWS Support gain one-on-one, fast-response support from AWS engineers. The service helps customers use AWS\u0026rsquo;s products and features. With pay-by-the-month pricing and unlimited support cases, customers are freed from long-term commitments. Customers with operational issues or technical questions can contact a team of support engineers and receive predictable response times and personalized support.\nMain Content Creating a new AWS Account Setting up MFA for the AWS Account root user Creating an Administrator Accounts and Groups Getting support for Account Authentication "
